# Game Review for Dirt 4

## Details

### Game Title
Dirt $

### Rating
I give this game a 8.5 out of 10
## Summary
  Dirt 4 has really good game play, the controls are easy to use for just about any player that feels like playing something different. Dirt has two different types of driving styles, one being for more for the casual player and another for someone who likes more of a challenge. 
  Dirt 4's track edit is simple to use, all it really consist of is sliders to edit track length, difficulty, and enviorment that the track will be located. There are plenty of cars to choose from and various styles. I'd say that this game is more for gamers that enjoy racing games but want something a little different than forza or gran tourismo. 
## Final Thoughts
I really enjoyed playing this game because it was challeging and offered something different then the racing games that I was used to playing.
