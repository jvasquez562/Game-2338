### Game Title
Shark Attack 

### Rating
I give this game a 2 out of 10. 

## Summary
The game was not that enjoyable, the rules of the game was not very clear. The game starts right away without any title screen.
The level is very basic and only last for about a minute or two, no instructions given in the discription no real details about the game.


## Final Thoughts
My final thoughts for shark attack was that the game did not seem complete and was very basic with no new levels and no progression what so ever.
The game has a very simple scoring system.
