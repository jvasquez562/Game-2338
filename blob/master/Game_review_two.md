# Game Review for Ravenfield

## Details

### Game Title
Ravenfield, https://steelraven7.itch.io/ravenfield

### Rating
I rate this game 6 out of 10

## Summary
This game is a really basic millitay game that has a few different maps to choose from. Ravenfield is also a non multiplayer game and what I mean by this is that it does not have an online feature that allows you to play with other gamers around the country. The controls for the game are basic an very similar to a lot of other games that are in the same genre (wasd) to move, left mouse to shoot, right mouse to aim, and space bar to jump. 

## Final Thoughts
I enjoyed this game i enjoyed the art style and the controls were very easy to understand and not hard to get the hang of.
