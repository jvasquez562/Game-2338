# Game Review for yu-gi-oh! Duel links 

## Details

### Game Title
yu-gi-oh! Duel links 

### Rating
I rate this game 8 out of 10 

## Summary
This game was fairly easy to get a hang of and easily addicted too. The game deals with similar scenarios as the tv shows with a lot of familiar faces.
The controls for the game were very simple and if you had played any of the other types of yo gi oh or even watched the tv show then understanding how to play was very simple.
Even if this was your first time ever seeing it and playing it the game does a very nice job of explaining rules at the very beginning in the toutorial.
The overall aspect of the game is to beat all the characters and build the best possible deck with the stongest monsters and trap cards. 
## Final Thoughts
This was an enjoyable game and i could see myself contiuing to play this outside of teh assignment.
